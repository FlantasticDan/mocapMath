Motion capture is expensive and complex, but what if it wasn't?

## Abstract
Motion capture isn't a new technology but rather it is well established.  Unfortunatly the tools used by the VFX industry on major motion pictures are expensive.  Specialized suits and/or capture studios aren't easy to come by.

At it's core all motion capture is geometric math, taking 2D images and comparing them to create 3D points.  The idea here is to use the free and open source Blender application's camera tracker to track and align multiple cameras in order to reconstruct 3D positional data of an actor's joints.
